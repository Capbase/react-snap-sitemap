# React Snap Sitemap

A companion package for [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap).

This package allows you to generate a sitemap.xml based off the created directories and files produced by react-snap.

This package was created based off [this comment](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/38#issuecomment-487350403) by [@erel](https://github.com/erel).

## Useage

Add `&& react-snap-sitemap --base-url='http://example.com/'` to the end of your build script, after you've called the `react-snap` command.
